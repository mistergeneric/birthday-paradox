## Basic Attempted Logic:

Counter set a zero

Run the following n times:
 
    Create List
    
    Generator 24 random integers between 0 < 365
    
    Add them to list
    
    Loop through list
    
    Return true if match

Increment of there has been a match

If counter > than half of n times the loop has run, there has been a match more than 50% of the time
